This code effectively creates an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard for users to manage customer data, with a focus on membership, renewal, and revenue information. It accomplishes this by utilizing several Python libraries, including Streamlit for web app development, Pandas for data manipulation, Altair for data visualization, Pyperclip for clipboard operations, and the datetime module for handling date-related tasks.

To populate the dashboard with relevant data, the script loads information from an Excel file named 'Elite.xlsx' into a Pandas DataFrame called 'df.' This data is extracted from the 'User' sheet, with the first 127 rows being imported.

The code establishes key variables, 'selected_username' and 'profile_picture,' which are intended to hold selected user data, although 'profile_picture' is not used in this context. Additionally, it employs session state management through 'st.session_state' to store user notes, facilitating efficient tracking and retrieval.

The script features essential functions such as 'calculate_renewal_date,' designed to determine renewal dates based on factors like membership and subscription types, and 'format_date,' which standardizes date formatting as 'mm/dd/yyyy.'

For user profile management, 'roster_search' enables users to search and view profiles using parameters like Name, Username, and Email.

To enhance data visualization, the 'create_membership_bar_chart' function counts and presents the number of members categorized by their membership type in the form of a chart.

The primary functionality is organized into a 'main' function, which serves as the entry point for the Streamlit app. This function presents a sidebar menu with four distinct options:

1. "Main Menu" offers insights into crucial statistics such as roster count, monthly revenue, coach rating, upcoming and past renewals, and a chart depicting membership distribution.

2. "Roster Search" empowers users to search and display profiles based on various criteria, including Name, Username, and Email.

3. "Buttons" provides clickable buttons for copying instructions, links, and text snippets to the clipboard, simplifying access to valuable resources.

4. "About" furnishes a table view of the loaded DataFrame.

In conclusion, this well-structured code creates a streamlined Streamlit web application. It equips users with a user-friendly dashboard to effortlessly manage customer data, gain insights through informative statistics, and access essential resources, ultimately enhancing efficiency and convenience.
